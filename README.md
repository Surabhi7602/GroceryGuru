# GroceryGuru
As college students, we’ve often found ourselves waiting on our friends to order groceries to avoid paying the high delivery charges which can at times be nearly as expensive as the groceries themselves! With Grocery Guru, you won’t have to worry about this anymore! Grocery guru is a group ordering website where people can plan collective orders. The website tracks how much money remains before the delivery becomes free. It's also sustainable because it helps cut down unnecessary trips to the grocery store.
